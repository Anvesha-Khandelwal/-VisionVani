 VisionVani: The AI That Sees and Talks
 What Is It?

VisionVani is an innovative website where a chatbot doesn’t just talk — it actually sees!
Using your webcam, the AI looks at the world around you in real-time and understands what it sees. Then, it chats with you and gives smart, helpful responses based on the objects it detects.

It’s like having a virtual assistant with eyes and a brain — built using a mix of smart web tech and powerful Python AI tools.

How It Works (The Magic Behind It)
The Eyes – Frontend (JavaScript)

Your browser acts as the AI’s eyes. It uses your webcam to capture live video and sends snapshots to the server using a fast system called WebSockets.

The Brain – Backend (Python)

On the backend, a Python program (powered by OpenCV and other computer vision tools) analyzes the incoming images.
It detects and identifies objects — for example, a “screwdriver,” “bottle,” or “keyboard” — and keeps track of what it sees.

The Advisor – Chat Intelligence

When you type something like “How do I fix this?”, the AI doesn’t just look at your text.
It also considers what it sees through the webcam — combining both to give you a smart, context-aware response.

Security and Personalization

Before you start, you’ll need to log in — ensuring privacy and data protection.
Plus, VisionVani can be tailored for different users or knowledge areas — whether it’s for engineering help, home repair, or learning support.
